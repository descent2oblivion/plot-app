# plot-app
Currently under development: Example of lets-plot-app from kotlin on Android

# Description
User inputs two numbers and the app displays a plot of them

# Issues
https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin/issues/21

# Attempted fix:
Download lets-plot-common-1.4.2.jar from https://bintray.com/beta/#/jetbrains/lets-plot-maven/lets-plot-jars/1.4.2?tab=overview and remove Kotlin from the archive. Archive is present in 'libs folder' renamed as 'lpc 1.4.2.jar' 

# Result
Error at \grafica.kt: (4, 18): Unresolved reference: datalore
